    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Because this blog is made of up <a href="/blog/categories/links">link posts</a> and original content posts, I wanted to make two customizations to Octopress to keep original content from getting lost under the volume of link posts.<!-- more --> The modifications I wanted to make were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hide all link posts from the index page.</li>
<li>Create a page just for link posts and provide navigation to it via the nav bar.</li>
</ol>


<p>I wasn't sure where to start because I am new to Octopress. My google-fu was questionable due to my lack of understanding Octopress' terminology.</p>

<h2>Hiding Link Posts from the Index Page</h2>

<p>Out of the two things I wanted to do, this was the easiest to find help with. I found this post about <a href="http://arshad.github.com/blog/2012/05/10/recipe-hiding-posts-from-the-octopress-front-page/">hiding posts from the octopress front page</a> almost right away.</p>

<p>The TLDR version of that post is: you need to assign a category to the posts you want to hide and then alter the pagination plugin to exclude that category.</p>

<h2>Creating a Page Just for the Hidden Category and Providing a Nav Link to It</h2>

<p>This one tripped me up for a bit. I quickly went down a black hole searching for things like "octopress create category page".</p>

<p>I couldn't find quite what I was looking for so I starting searching for other Octopress based blogs to see if anyone had done such a thing. After I came across <a href="http://time.to.pullthepl.ug/blog/archives/">this</a> blog, the answer was obvious. Octopress already creates category specific pages. In order to provide a nav link to the category, I simply needed to edit the _source/custom/navigation.html file like so:<br/>
```html</p>

<ul class="main-navigation">
  <!-- other nav links -->
  <li><a href="/blog/categories/links">10,000 Links</a></li>
  <!-- other nav links -->
</ul>


<p>```</p>
