[A Look Over the Fence](http://rubysource.com/a-look-over-the-fence-asp-net/)  
Here are a Rubyist's thoughts after trying modern .NET / C# / ASP.NET MVC. Personally, I've worked with two experienced Rubyists that have been pleasantly surprised with ASP.NET MVC now that it has reached maturity.

## Caught in a .NET
[Manage Cookies using Web API](http://tostring.it/2012/12/03/manage-cookies-using-web-api/)  
I'm not a fan of using cookies in an HTTP API, but this post is useful if you have to do it.

## Monoculture
[NuGet Addin for MonoDevelop](http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2013/01/07/MonoDevelopNuGetAddin.aspx)  
This is a huge step in the right direction for Mono. The platform is mature, but the lack of easy NuGet integration has been painful in my experience. I recently worked on a project that started out on Mono but eventually fell back to Windows/.NET because of the lack of NuGetness.
