[A Look Over the Fence](http://rubysource.com/a-look-over-the-fence-asp-net/)  
Here are a Rubyist's thoughts after trying modern .NET / C# / ASP.NET MVC. Personally, I've worked with two experienced Rubyists that have been pleasantly surprised with ASP.NET MVC now that it has reached maturity.

## Caught in a .NET
[Manage Cookies using Web API](http://tostring.it/2012/12/03/manage-cookies-using-web-api/)  
I'm not a fan of using cookies in an HTTP API, but this post is useful if you have to do it. 

[OData Service for Team Foundation Server v2](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/archive/2013/01/07/odata-service-for-team-foundation-server-v2.aspx)  
I used to poo-poo TFS APIs until my coworker wrote a killer app to figure out which NuGet packages where used across the enterprise. 

[RavenDB 2.0 RTM](http://ayende.com/blog/160642/ravendb-2-0-rtm?key=1ffa4e58-1630-451a-a2ca-49169c134af7&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AyendeRahien+%28Ayende+%40+Rahien%29)

## Monoculture
[NuGet Addin for MonoDevelop](http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2013/01/07/MonoDevelopNuGetAddin.aspx)  
This is a huge step in the right direction for Mono. The platform is mature, but the lack of easy NuGet integration has been painful in my experience. I recently worked on a project that started out on Mono but eventually fell back to Windows/.NET because of the lack of NuGetness.
