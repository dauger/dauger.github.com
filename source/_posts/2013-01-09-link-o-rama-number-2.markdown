## JabbaScript
[The Role of Interfaces in TypeScript](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2013/01/08/the-role-of-interfaces-in-typescript.aspx)  
I have a love / hate relationship with C# interfaces. I love them when I'm writing implementation code, but I hate them when unit testing because I'd usually rather have duck typing. Now they are available to JavaScript coders via TypeScript.

I don't do Ruby in my day job, but I love the current discussion surrounding OOP in the Ruby Community. The Ruby Rogues podcast has been one of my favorite podcasts over the past year or two.  

## Hardware Wars
[Valve's Gabe Newell on Steam Box, Biometrics, and the Future of Gaming](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming)  
The "Steam Box" concept continues look promising.



## Caught in a .NET  
[Microsoft debuts an OSS VM Hub](http://vmdepot.msopentech.com/List/Index)  
I would have laughed you out of the room if you told me this would exist a year ago. Microsoft continues to win me over with their recent OSS efforts. Azure has turned out to be a great platform.  

[Steve Bohlen goes to work for Microsoft](https://twitter.com/sbohlen/status/289037857283248129)  
I've learned a lot from this guy over the years through his contributions to the developer community. I think this is a great fit for him.

[Ten Tricks for Razor Views](http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2013/01/09/ten-tricks-for-razor-views.aspx)  
Did you know all of these? I didn't.  

[Building a Real-time Exception Monitor with NServiceBus and SignalR](http://ryantomlinson.com/post/Building-a-real-time-exception-monitor-with-NServiceBus-and-SignalR.aspx)  
Two cool technologies come together to make a really neat error dashboard.

[Mono 3.0.3 has been released](http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_3.0#New_in_Mono_3.0.3)   
The major features of this release relate to concurrent GC and improvements in async.  


## Software Craftineering  
[IDE Culture vs. Unix philosophyy](http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/ide-culture-vs-unix-philosophy/)  
This is a pretty epic rant against IDE culture.  

## Hyper Media
[Behind the scenes of Bowie's Bold New Website](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/new-bowie-website-1131634)   
David Bowie's website has mirrored his career over the past decade - it was last redesigned 10 years ago. I'm happy to see it revamped.  

[My Father's "Eviscerated" Work](http://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/my-father-039-s-quot-eviscerated-quot-work-son-of-hobbit-scribe-j.r.r.-tolkien-finally-speaks-out/hobbit-silmarillion-lord-of-rings/c3s10299/#.UO4rdonjn6_)  
It turns out that Christopher Tolkien is not a fan of Peter Jackson's movies. Personally, I love both the novels and the movies, but I can see where he is coming from.  

## Game over, man!
[Commodore Microcomputer Magazine](http://archive.org/details/commodore_microcomputer)  
New (old) Commodore magazines are up at archive.org

It turns out that Planescape: Torment's spiritual successor is going to be set in the Numenera setting. I'm very happy about this.
