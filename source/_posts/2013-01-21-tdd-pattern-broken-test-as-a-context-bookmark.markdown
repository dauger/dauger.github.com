I've been meaning to write about this technique for many years now, but two things have finally influenced me to put the words down:  

1. I took a trip last week which kept me from coding, and I used this technique to get me back on track this morning.
2. I came across this post today about context switching: [Programmer Interrupted](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/)

The technique is this simple. Leave yourself a failing unit test at the end of the day as a reminder of where you were. This will help you get back into the flow the next time you start coding.
