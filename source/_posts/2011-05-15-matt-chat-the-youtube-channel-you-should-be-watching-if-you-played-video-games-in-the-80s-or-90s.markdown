Nerd service announcement:

If you played video games in the 80s and/or 90s and have never heard of, or watched [Matt Chat](http://www.youtube.com/user/blacklily8), you you are in for a treat. One of my friends aptly described it as, “Behind the Music for vintage video games.” <!-- more -->

Matt Barton (College Professor and Author) debuted [Matt Chat](http://www.youtube.com/user/blacklily8) in February 2009 with a low-production-quality, but loving, retrospective of SSI’s classic AD&D CRPG, “Pool of Radiance.” Since then, Matt has produced an additional 100 episodes, and has made leaps-and-bounds in production value. In addition to his editorial retrospectives, Matt began doing interviews with game developers around episode 40.
