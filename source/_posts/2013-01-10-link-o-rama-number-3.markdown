[Dependency injection != Inversion of Control](http://chrismdp.com/2013/01/dependency-injection-not-ioc/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)  
A nice reminder that you can do dependency injection without using a container.

[Where is PhoneGap for Windows Phone 8? Right here!](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jerrynixon/archive/2013/01/10/where-is-phonegap-for-windows-phone-8-right-here.aspx)

[Simple immutable objects](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/andrewarnottms/archive/2013/01/08/simple-immutable-objects.aspx)  
In this post Andrew shows us how to create functional programming style immutable objects in C# that have a lower memory footprint and less GC pressure than those created by traditional immutable object design approaches.

[New Windows Azure Mobile Services Getting Started Content](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2013/01/09/new-windows-azure-mobile-services-getting-started-content.aspx)  
I think Azure Mobile Services has a lot of promise. It has a low barrier to entry, and it is built on top of node.js. Yet it's missing some very basic software engineering features such as not editing code on a live server. I hope a happy medium between barrier to entry and engineering is found soon because this is a really compelling platform.

Your one stop show for Azure CLI automation.

[OWIN - Run your C# for the web anywhere - Louis DeJardin](https://vimeo.com/57007898)  
Videos from the 2012 MonkeySpace conference have started to appear on Vimeo. This one is about OWIN which is a standard interface between .NET/Mono webservers and applications. It is very similiar to Rack if you are coming from the Ruby world.

[Expanding ServiceStack's reach with Mono - Demis Bellot](https://vimeo.com/55817065)  
Here's a 2nd MonkeySpace video for today. This one is about [ServiceStack](http://www.servicestack.net/). I've been learning a bit about it lately and I am very impressed. If you haven't heard about it before, it's an opinionated / convention-based web service stack for .NET that prides itself on its Mono compatibility.

Let's hope this means there are oodles and oodles of bonus tracks left over from the long recording process.

It's a brave new world for parenting. Here's a mother's thoughts on learning to play Minecraft to spend more time with her children, and how it opened up a new avenue of parenting to her.

I'm not a huge fan of fully CGI game trailers, but CDPR is one of those rare companies that can capture the magic and promise of a game in a CGI trailer.

[CDPR to announce 'other open-world game' on February 5](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/386040/cdpr-to-announce-other-open-world-game-on-february-5/?cid=OTC-RSS&attr=CVG-News-RSS&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)  
If the rumors are true, I'm not sure what to think. Isn't one of the awesome things about "The Witcher" series is that it ISN'T an open world?

These bamboo-housed keyboards and mice look great. Must resist!

Maybe there is still hope for Windows Phone? Nokia seems to be pretty happy with it, but then again, they don't have much choice.
